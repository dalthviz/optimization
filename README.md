# Optimization
Repository for part of the source code of a implementation of local search of a optimum by generation of a neighbourhood. For a good function of the application do not put in the textfield of "Porcentaje sigma" numbers lower than 6 or higher than 100. To run the application you would have to build the project (the main method is in the class Interface of the pinterface package).
